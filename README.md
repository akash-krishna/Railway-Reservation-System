# Railway-Reservation-System
Generate and Manage Railway Reservation Details

and Database Tables of Microsoft SQL Server.

Administrator can reserve train tickets on selected journey path after entering the passenger details and payment confirmation.
Once ticket is 'booked successfully' the PNR number and Seat numbers are generated and the reservation details is stored in the database.
The user can view the booked history and cancel reserved tickets that are 24h ahead from system time.
Cancelled tickets are moved to cancelled history database and the admin can delete these records as well.
Expired tickets are also available in the history database unless the admin have deleted those records.
